# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: December 7, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Learning basic JS from Udemy.

**Thoughts:** Initially thought I could test JS scripts in VS code but decided to just run the html containing the scripts in Chrome. Was able to answer the first assignment from Learn to Program in Javascript. Trying to work around github as well as it has been few months since I relied on version control.

**Today's Progress**: Setting up my platform.

**Thoughts:** Was able to retrieve my credentials for my website. It is with Wordpress.com currently but I hope to customize it better in Wordpress.org once I have attained enough confidence in my JS skill. I focused on sharing metaheuristics for optimisation on todays post.
