# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: December 7, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Learning basic JS from Udemy.

**Thoughts:** Initially thought I could test JS scripts in VS code but decided to just run the html containing the scripts in Chrome. Was able to answer the first assignment from Learn to Program in Javascript. Trying to work around github as well as it has been few months since I relied on version control.

### Day 1: December 8, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Setting up my platform.

**Thoughts:** Was able to retrieve my credentials for my website. It is with Wordpress.com currently but I hope to customize it better in Wordpress.org once I have attained enough confidence in my JS skill. I focused on sharing metaheuristics for optimisation on todays post.

### Day 2: December 9, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Population-based Heuristics.

**Thoughts:** This implementation is what I enjoyed more compared to Single-state heuristics. The challenge in replicating how our genetic makeup is formed was exciting. Compared to the single states models, GA gave a more optimal solution to the knapsack problem.

### Day 3: December 10, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Load distribution optimisation task.

**Thoughts:** This implementation was a challenge more so on the mathemtical side of it rather than the implementation of it. Going deeper into computer science, I reckon that having a strong maths understanding is essential.

### Day 4: December 11, 2019

**Today's Progress**: List manipulation on Javascript.

**Thoughts:** This was an easy task as I have previously coded in Python. Although, the last question was worded weirdly that I had trouble working on it.

### Day 5: December 12, 2019

**Today's Progress**: List and string manipulation on Javascript.

**Thoughts:** Learning that function can be set to a variable made me excited. It was handy but still needs lots of practice for it.

### Day 6: December 13, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Project Proposal.

**Thoughts:** Had a uni assessment due today so worked on that one and described the features we will be adding to an iOS app. No code done but explored UX and known bugs from previous implementation.

### Day 7: December 14, 2019

**Today's Progress**: OOP in JS.

**Thoughts:** I enjoy writing OOPrograms so this assignment was pretty easy to deal with. The constructor is similar to writing a function, much different than writing them in C#. I didn't mind it though.

**Link to work:** [Assignment 4](https://github.com/mjocen/uni-tasks/blob/master/learning-js/section4-assignment/assign.js)


### Day 8: December 15 2019

**Today's Progress**: Project J.

**Thoughts:** A friend and I will be working on a project together for materials request program. We will be using VueJS for front end, Python and MySQL for backend.

### Day 9: December 16 2019

**Today's Progress**: Explore swift

**Thoughts:** Need to explore our codebase for our uni project so I had to check swift tutorials. Familiarized myself with syntaxes and data types.

### Day 10: December 17 2019

**Today's Progress**: None

**Thoughts:** This is me putting things on hold and had other commitments and couldn't even insert any coding time.

**Link to work:** *Can't be shown since there's none*


### Day 11: December 18 2019

**Today's Progress**: Enhancement for a project using Objective-C

**Thoughts:** Not much coding but more on research of the codebase for our project, educational app for young Australians. We have to include differrent fonts in Australia as currently, the app only uses Victorian font. Yes, I recently learned about this as well.

### Day 12: December 19 2019

**Today's Progress**: Investigate code base for an iOS app.

**Thoughts:**  I'll call this app as Azes for its alias. Azes is already in App Store but not naming it for now, I also don't know why. The code base was simple but taking a bit of time learning Objective-C conventions and how they are organized within the source.

### Day 13: December 20 2019

**Today's Progress**: Iteration over JSON file in JavaScript.

**Thoughts:** This was asked from me from a friend and I was keen to help. It was fun as iteration over Dictionary-like variables and iterators. I updated my previous code assignment to test this iteration. It is becoming a struggle to continue this as the holidays are coming but hoping to build the habit.

### Day 14: December 21 2019

**Today's Progress**: Missed this day.

**Thoughts:** Wasn't able to do some coding but had reflection on what are the things I've done for the year.


### Day 15: December 22 2019

**Today's Progress**: Codewars.

**Thoughts:** I've found this site before but had not participated in any of the practices in it. I was able to levelup to 7 Kyu (1 level above starting). I'm mostly focusing on Python for this one but hoping to move with JS/C#/C++. Lots of option actually.
